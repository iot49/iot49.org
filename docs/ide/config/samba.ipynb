    "Applications include exporting to another machine (e.g. a laptop) to easily exchange files. If you have several computers running *ide49* you can dedicate one as server and the other as clients.\n",

    "To enable the Samba server, edit the appropriate variables in `/service-config/iot-home/.env49rc`. Set `SAMBA=server` or `client`, specify the correct IP address of the server, and choose a strong password. \n",
