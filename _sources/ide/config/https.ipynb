    "When the browser connects to the server, the server sends the certificate. The browser decodes it and verifies that the URLs match (which is why the certificate changes when you alter the [`DNS_NAME`](dns)). It also sends a challenge to the server which requires the private key to solve. \n",
    "\n",
    "*ide49* stores the private key at `/service-config/nginx/ssl/cert.key`. It looks similar to the certificate but I won't reproduce it here since it is private, aka secret. The private key on your instance differs, even if you use the same `DNS_NAME`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the browser checks if the certificate is valid. This is a bit like a customs agent checking your passport-s/he verifies your name, picture, eye color and what do I know, and then also makes sure your passport is a real passport issued by a real country. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here lies the problem with *ide49*'s certificates: they meet all requirements and the encryption is just as strong as with a real certificate, but the browser has never seen one alike. Just like the customs agent rejects the beautiful passport you created yourself on your 3D printer, the browser won't trust certificates issued by *ide49*. \n",
    "\n",
    "This begs the question how browsers verify certificates from other websites such as https://iot49.org. The answer is that browsers come with preinstalled certificates (an elaborate chaining scheme permits one certficate to vouch for many derived certificates), but unfortunately the certificates created by *ide49* are not among them.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two solutions to this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Buy a real domain name like `iot49.org` or `google.com` and get a real certificate for it from a real [certificate authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority). You'll also need to expose your device to the internet (not just locally).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Alternatively you can add the certificate of your device to the list of trusted certificates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Adding certificates depends on the operating system. \"Google\" *add certificate to chrome* or something similar for instructions for your setup. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your efforts will be rewarded with a nice lock displayed in the search bar and there will no longer be warnings when you connect to https://iot49.local.\n",
