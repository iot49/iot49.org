They also use chaining to limit the number of certificates that need be stored and avoid the need to get a new certificate each time a new website goes onling. The certificate received from the bank's webserver is checked against these built-in certificates. If no match is found, the browser issues a warning (e.g. \"Your connection is not private\") and refuses to connect.\n",
