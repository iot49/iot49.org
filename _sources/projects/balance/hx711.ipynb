    "# \"Precision\" Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "How could we improve the accuracy of the scale? Besides the obvious - a better ADC - there are a few other steps we should take.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important is to change the ADC to use the bridge voltage as reference, rather than the built-in precision reference or supply voltage. \n",
    "\n",
    "The voltage at the output of the bridge is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    v_{\\textrm{bridge}} = S \\times V_{\\textrm{s}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S$ is a scale factor that is proportional to the weight and $V_{\\textrm{s}}V_{\\textrm{s}}$ is the voltage across the bridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output code from an ADC is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    D_\\textrm{out} = \\frac{v_\\textrm{bridge}}{V_\\textrm{ref}} = S \\times \\frac{V_\\textrm{s}}{V_\\textrm{ref}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that $V_\\textrm{s}$ is the voltage of the battery powering the scale and $V_\\textrm{ref}V_\\textrm{ref}$ is a constant precision reference voltage. As the battery voltage decreases over time, the ratio $V_\\textrm{s}/V_\\textrm{ref}$ decreases, resulting in a gain error.\n",
    "\n",
    "This and a host of other errors are avoided if $V_\\textrm{s}=V_\\textrm{ref}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrated circuits for reading bridge outputs such as the [HX711](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/ForceFlex/hx711_english.pdfhttps://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/ForceFlex/hx711_english.pdf) include all the necessary circuits, including the amplifier and ADC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's modify our scale to use an [HX711 breakout board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13879https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13879). Short the $V_\\mathrm{DD}$ and $V_\\mathrm{CC}$ pins to `VUSB` of the ESP32 and `GND` to ground. Note that although the breakout board states a minimum supply of just 2.7V and hence operation from a single cell rechargable Lithium battery, doing so requires changing the feedback resistors, $R_1$ and/or $R_2$. Tie `DAT` and `CLK` to two used pins of the ESP32. The code below assumes 12 and 27, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also wire the load cell to the pins provided on the breakout board. My load cell does not have a shield, hence I left that pin unconnected. However I \"twisted\" the green and white wires from the load cell in an attempt to minimize electromagnic interference. Making these wires as short as possible also helps with noise."
